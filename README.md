# Dotfiles
This repository contains the dotfiles used to set up a MacBook Pro M3 with the preferences and dev tools suited for my own personal needs.
The project is divided in the following files:
- **.macos**, containing several macOS specific preferences, taken from https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.macos and edited as needed;
- **.zshrc**, zsh shell configuration file;
- **aliases.zsh**, zsh file containing various aliases I find useful;
- **boot.sh**, entry script to run when setting up a new machine;
- **Brewfile**, list of tools to install through Brew (which is installed in boot.sh).
